# Postman Collections

In order to simplify development and documentation of the various Middleware API's, we use actual modelled API calls.
These calls have been created using the [Postman][post]. Postman allows importing of those collections:

1. Install and open postman
1. Click the `import` button on the top left of the postman window
1. Select "import folder", click "choose folder"
1. Select the folder `postman` inside this `docs` directory

This imports the available collections with all pre-configured API calls.
